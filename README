### Examples of SMEFTatNLO computations

Standalone bash scripts are the following:

- `gen_single_top_4f.sh`: Compute single top production at NLO in QCD with `cQq13` or `cQq83` four-fermion operator (at fixed order, in the five flavour scheme where t and s channels are not separated). NLO overlap with tW associated production is removed with the `$$ syntax. The W width has to be set to zero to preserve gauge invariance (and ensure pole cancellation). In the cQq83 case, a user loop filter is needed to include loops involving both a gluon and a W that are otherwise not considered as pure QCD ones.

- `test-topfcnc-pp2th.sh`: Compute FCNC production of a top and a Higgs (`pp>th`) at NLO in QCD with `RCtphi` operator coefficient from the (https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/TopFCNC)[TopFCNC] model. The `$$ t~` syntax is used to remove the `pp>tt~` contribution with `t~>hj` arises at NLO.
